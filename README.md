# Analyzing IMDB Top 250 Movies using Tableau
## 1. Project Summary 

The goal of this project was to practice using **Tableau** for exploratory analysis and visualizations. I did this analysis using the data about movies featured in IMDB's [Top 250 Movies chart](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/) from 1996 to 2021.

During this project, I also had a chance to practice **extracting data from public APIs using Python** and **transforming the data for analysis using SQL**. 

## 2. Tableau Dashboards

There were many possible approaches to the analysis because the final dataset had many interesting attributes about the movies: IMDB rating, genres, evolution in rankings, budget, etc. (see **3.1 Final Dataset**). I decided to approach the analysis from a few different angles and the outcome was a set of 4 different dashboards:
  1. [Interactive exploratory dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/IMDBTop250-Overview/MoviesinIMDBTop250?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). It presents an overview of the movies in the chart for a selected year. 
  2. [Financial Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/IMDBTop250-Financials/Financials?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). It presents insights into the financial aspect of the movies: budgets, revenues, profitability, etc. 
  3. [Ratings Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/IMDBTop250_16980672361840/Ratings?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). It contains insights into what drives the IMDB user ratings.
  4. [Evolution Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/IMDBTop250-Evolution/EvolutionoverTime?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). It presents insights into how the movie industry has evolved from 1996 (the chart's first year) to 2021.

## 3. Data Preparation

### 3.1 Final Dataset

All the data used for the analysis is available in the [Data folder](Data/Final/). It is a set of **XXXX .csv files.** 

**TODO:** Add some explanation about the final dataset (if not yet explained in other sections): list files, and their purpose, format, and sample of each file. 

### 3.2 Source Data

To complete the analysis, I collected the data from 2 sources and merged them: ranking data from a Kaggle dataset and additional movie details from The Movie Database (TMDB) API.

#### 3.2.1 Main Dataset from Kaggle

The main source of data was a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mustafacicek/imdb-top-250-lists-1996-2020) containing the basic attributes of all movies featured in the IMDB Top 250 chart from 1996 to 2021 and respective ranking of the movie each year. You can download the csv file from [Data folder](Data/Raw/IMDB/). 

There was a single table and each row of the table was a pair of movie details + movie ranking for a given year. There were 26 years of ranking and the chart features 250 movies, so the dataset has 6500 (26 x 250) rows.

Each row had the following attributes: 

| **Column** | **Description** | **Format** | Sample data |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ranking | Position of the movie in the chart | Integer | 3 |
| IMDBYear | The year of the Top 250 chart | Integer | 2001 |
| IMDBLink | Part of the IMDB URL which points to the movie | String | /tt0060196/ <br/> (Full URL would be https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060196/) |
| Title | Title of the movie | String | The Good, the Bad and the Ugly |
| Date | Year when the movie was released | Integer | 1966 |
| RunTime | How long the movie is (in minutes) | Integer | 145 |
| Genre | A string listing all the genres associated with the movie (this data is entered by IMDB users) | String | Comedy, Crime, Drama |
| Rating | IMDB Score of the movie (as of 2021 - the last year of the dataset) | Float | 8.64 |
| Score | Score of the movie on the Metacritic website (as of 2021) | Integer | 64 |
| Votes | Number of votes for the movie on the IMDB website (as of 2021) | Integer | 105400 |
| Gross | Box Office revenue generated by the movie (in Millions) | Float | 905.14 |
| Director | String containing the list of the names of the directors of the movie | String | Charles Crichton,  John Cleese |
| Cast1 | Name of the cast member appearing first on the movie webpage on the IMDB site. | String | Mel Gibson |
| Cast2 | Name of the cast member appearing second (if there is one) on the movie webpage on the IMDB site. | String | Julia Sawalha |
| Cast3 | Name of the cast member appearing third (if there is one) on the movie webpage on the IMDB site. | String | Phil Daniels |
| Cast4 | Name of the cast member appearing fourth (if there is one) on the movie webpage on the IMDB site. | String | Lynn Ferguson |

| Ranking | IMDByear | IMDBlink | Title | Date | RunTime | Genre | Rating | Score | Votes | Gross | Director | Cast1 | Cast2 | Cast3 | Cast4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 168 | 2000 | /title/tt0120630/ | Chicken Run | 2000 | 84 | Animation, Adventure, Comedy | 7 | 88 | 185939 | 106.83 | Peter Lord,  Nick Park | Mel Gibson | Julia Sawalha | Phil Daniels | Lynn Ferguson |
| 239 | 2001 | /title/tt0120630/ | Chicken Run | 2000 | 84 | Animation, Adventure, Comedy | 7 | 88 | 185939 | 106.83 | Peter Lord,  Nick Park | Mel Gibson | Julia Sawalha | Phil Daniels | Lynn Ferguson |
| 203 | 1998 | /title/tt0120780/ | Out of Sight | 1998 | 123 | Comedy, Crime, Drama | 7 | 85 | 90519 | 37.56 | Steven Soderbergh | George Clooney | Jennifer Lopez | Ving Rhames | Steve Zahn |
| 211 | 1997 | /title/tt0055614/ | West Side Story | 1961 | 153 | Crime, Drama, Musical | 7.5 | 86 | 107792 | 43.66 | Jerome Robbins,  Robert Wise | Natalie Wood | George Chakiris | Richard Beymer | Russ Tamblyn |
| 205 | 1998 | /title/tt0055614/ | West Side Story | 1961 | 153 | Crime, Drama, Musical | 7.5 | 86 | 107792 | 43.66 | Jerome Robbins,  Robert Wise | Natalie Wood | George Chakiris | Richard Beymer | Russ Tamblyn |

#### 3.2.2 Enriching with TMDB API

I decided to enrich the Kaggle dataset because it had a few issues:
  1. Based on a few samples, the revenue data was not reliable at all.
  2. There was no data on the budgets. I wanted to analyze the profitability.
  3. TMDB data had some additional attributes such as language, country of production, etc., which Kaggle data didn't have.

The Movie Database (TMDB) platform has a convenient API that is free for the registered users. I wrote a Python script to connect to this API and collect the data about the movies listed in my original dataset. **Please note** that the Python code is very hacky because I haven't properly looked into using Python yet. 

The Python script and the results from the API extraction are available in the [Data folder](Data/Raw/TMDB)
